## Assumptions

We assume,

Starting time of the the simulation is `t_initial = 0`, Year 0,

The final time of the simulation is `t_final = 100`, Year 100,

The initial amount of the substance is `N_0 = 1600`, 1.6 kg, based on [this calculation](/assumptions/initial_value.md),

The decay rate is: $r = \frac{\ln(2)}{30} \times -1$, based on [this calculation](/assumptions/decay_rate.md).
