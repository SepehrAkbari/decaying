## Initial Value of Cesium-137

Cesium-137 is generated primarily from the fission of uranium and plutonium isotopes within nuclear reactors. For typical commercial nuclear reactors like Isar 2, it is estimated that approximately 0.1 to 0.3 grams of Cesium-137 are produced per gigawatt-day (GWd) of electricity generated/.

The Isar 2 plant has a net electrical output of about 1400 megawatts (MW). Over an 18-month cycle, which can be estimated to produce around 10-11 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, the total energy output can be converted into gigawatt-days. 

$$ 
1400 \text{ MW} \times 18 \text{ months} \times (\frac{30 \text{ days}}{1 \text{ month}} \times \frac{24 \text{ hours}}{1 \text{ day}} \times \frac{1 \text{ GW}}{1000 \text{ MW}}) \approx 8000 \text{ GWd}
$$

This calculation shows that Isar 2 would generate approximately 8000 GWd of electricity during this period. 

$$
8000 \text{ GWd} \times \frac{0.1 \text{ grams}}{1 \text{ GWd}} \leq N_0 \text{ grams} \leq 8000 \text{ GWd} \times \frac{0.3 \text{ grams}}{1 \text{ GWd}}
$$

We need a single value for the initial quantity of Cesium-137, so although not the most accurate, but a reasonable estimate would be the average of the lower and upper bounds:

$$
8000 \text{ GWd} \times \frac{0.2 \text{ grams}}{1 \text{ GWd}} \approx 1600 \text{ grams}
$$

Considering operational practices, regulatory limits, and containment strategies, it is logical to conclude that a realistic initial quantity of Cesium-137, prior to decay, would be around **1600 grams**.

Note: The actual initial quantity of Cesium-137 through a cycle in Isar 2 would rely on the specific amount of fuel (MOX and Uranium) used, the effieciency of the reactor, and the operational practices of the plant, etc which are not publicly available. The value of 1600 grams however, is a reasonable estimate for the scope of this project.
