## Decay Rate of Cesium-137

The decay of Cesium-137 follows an exponential decay model, where the number of radioactive nuclei decreases over time. The decay constant is calculated by:

$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$

The half-life of Cesium-137 is approximately 30 years, which corresponds to a decay constant of:

$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{30} \approx 0.0231 \text{ years}^{-1} $$

Of course the quantity of Cesium-137 will reduce over time, so our "growth rate" will be negative, which could be represented as:

$$ -\lambda = -\frac{\ln(2)}{30} \rightarrow r = \frac{\ln(2)}{30} \times -1$$
