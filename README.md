# Modeling the Nuclear Decay of Cesium-137

Isar 2, a nuclear power plant located in Bavaria, Germany, operated from 1988 until its shutdown in 2023. Situated on the banks of the Isar River, a tributary of the Danube, the plant faced controversy due to concerns over potential radioactive contamination of the river water. This issue was one of the factors in the German government’s nuclear phase-out plan, ultimately leading to Isar 2’s closure as the last operational nuclear power plant in the country.

In this project, Cesium-137 was examined, one of the most hazardous radioactive isotopes, a by-product of nuclear power plants using uranium as fuel, like Isar 2. Modeling its decay will help evaluate the environmental impact of the Isar 2 nuclear power plant and assess the potential risks associated with the release of this radioactive isotope into the surrounding ecosystem.
